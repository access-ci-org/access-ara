Creating a basic flask app for the recommender. We might not end up withing the app itself but the underlying javascript and html might prove useful.

To run, start a virtual environment and install flask. Next just type `flask run` in the terminal folder.


**TODO:**
Add the scoring based on different package requirements

Hide the followup questions until the original questions are answered.

Make the Long-Term Storage and Temp Storage questions dependant on the answer to the Data Storage question
(Currently the answers to the Temp Storage and Long-Term Storage questions will affect the score even if the user says they don't need to store info on the RP)

Calculate and display the scores after each selection.
